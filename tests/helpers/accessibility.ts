 * Assert the current page has no axe accessibility violations.
 *
 * The opt-in per-route counterpart to the fixture-wide scan, which runs on every
 * passing test but does not assert yet (see testing.md). A route is added here
 * once it is clean, chipping away at the deferred fixture-wide assertion.
 *
 * Legacy mode is required, since otherwise axe opens a blank aggregation page via
 * `context.newPage()`, which Electron does not support. On failure the rule ids
 * are surfaced through the assertion, so a violation is debuggable at a glance.
 *
 * Pass `disableRules` to scope out rules the route does not pass yet (an app-wide
 * `color-contrast` issue, say), so a route can still enforce every other rule
 * ahead of the full assertion. Omit it to assert against every rule.
