'@elek-io/client': patch

Render field-definition groups and finish adapting the dynamic form system to @elek-io/core 0.20.0. Groups in a Collection's fieldDefinitions are shown as labeled fieldsets in the Entry form and Collection editor, field definitions are flattened where grouping is irrelevant, and a Project's commit history now comes from a dedicated projects.history query instead of the Project read. Form typing was reworked to infer react-hook-form types from the generated Zod schemas.
