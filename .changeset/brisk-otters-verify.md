Add Playwright E2E tests that build the unpacked app and run against it in CI, across the same platforms as Core, with an isolated Electron userData directory and Core 0.21's ELEK_IO_DATA_DIR for test data. Modernize the toolchain to Electron 43 with electron-vite 5 on the Node 24 runtime, TypeScript 6, eslint 10, pnpm 11 supply-chain policies, and refreshed dependencies including lucide-react 1.x and react-day-picker 10. CD now publishes build artifacts to a draft GitHub Release.
